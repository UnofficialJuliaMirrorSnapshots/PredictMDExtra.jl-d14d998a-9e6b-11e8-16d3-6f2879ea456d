PredictMDExtra is a meta-package that installs all of the Julia dependencies
of [PredictMD](https://predictmd.net) (but not PredictMD itself).

Installing PredictMDExtra does not install PredictMD. If you would like a
convenient way of installing PredictMD and all of its Julia dependencies,
see [PredictMDFull](https://github.com/bcbi/PredictMDFull.jl).

## Installation

PredictMDExtra is registered in the Julia General registry. Therefore, to
install PredictMDExtra, simply open Julia and run the following three lines:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("PredictMDExtra")
import PredictMDExtra
```

That being said, PredictMDExtra is not very useful by itself. Instead, I
recommend that you install PredictMDFull, which includes both PredictMD and
PredictMDExtra. To install PredictMDFull, simply open Julia and run the
following three lines:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("PredictMDFull")
import PredictMDFull
```
